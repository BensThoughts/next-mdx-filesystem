In this article I am going to show you how I created a staggered animation first with [Framer
Motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/) and then refactored the code to use
[@emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) CSS-in-JS. The first section describes the
advantages and disadvantages of Framer Motion and how I use it for prototyping. The second section shows
the example component created with Framer Motion. The last section shows the example component refactored
with @emotion/styled.

## Framer Motion Advantages

I love **Framer Motion**. It is an easy to use, flexible, and very powerful animation library. It's
performance is quite good as well. Putting together semi-complex animations in which multiple elements
animate based on the states of each other is very easy to do with Framer Motion. We can use React
features like `useState()` and `useEffect()` to easily orchestrate animations based on hover and
focus events. One of the largest advantages of using Framer Motion is that it saves the animation state
at every frame along the path of keyframes. Meaning, if we are animating based on some state such as
hover or focus and then loose that hover or focus the animation can smoothly reverse course and render
the animation in reverse back to the original state. With CSS animations our components will immediately
snap back to their original states as defined at the first keyframe. This is a consideration you must
take into account when deciding if a refactor is going to be possible.

>Note: Try hovering over and out on the 2 codesandbox.io examples to see the difference in how the
animation reverses when it is interrupted mid animation. [With Framer
Motion](https://codesandbox.io/s/staggered-animation-w-framer-motion-8clmm?file=/src/components/BlogCard.tsx)
[With
@emotion/Styled](https://codesandbox.io/s/staggered-animation-w-emotion-styled-p9uki?file=/pages/index.tsx)

>Note: You will probably need to hit refresh on the embedded browser window after the code sand box
compiles the app for the @emotion/styled example.

## Framer Motion Disadvantages

There are 2 primary downsides to using Framer Motion along with `useState()` and `useEffect()` hooks
to orchestrate hover and focus animations. First, we are re-rendering the component every time we hover
or focus on it. Second, there is a price to pay in bundle size. Framer Motion will add at minimum 23.4k
to any page that imports it. The Framer Motion documentation claims that we can reduce our initial bundle
size to under 5kb using [Lazy Motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/lazy-motion/). However in practice the
bundle size of a page that uses even the bare minimum of features is 23.4k g-zipped added on top of our
pages bundle size, so if we want animation on our main index/home page the user is going to have to load
all of that. Often in practice using it actually adds that 23.4k to the javascript of every page in our
app if we end up wrapping the whole app in the Lazy Motion component and splitting our javascript code page by page.

## Using Framer for Prototyping

I am going to show you how to create a staggered and orchestrated animation with Framer Motion and then
refactor the code to use @emotion/styled CSS-in-JS. Using Framer motion for prototyping has the advantage
of being able to easily play around with and fine tune various animation styles quickly. In most
cases I have found that my Framer Motion animations actually turn out to be very easy to refactor into
CSS, especially when using a library that supports CSS-in-JS, such as @emotion/styled. These libraries
allow us to use Javascript variables in our CSS so they can really make the process of refactoring the
animation much simpler.

## The Example Component

As an an example I will show you the process of refactoring my BlogCard component from using Framer
Motion with useState and useEffect hooks to using the @emotion/styled CSS-in-JS API. The component is
shown here...

<BlogCard
  id='staggered-animation-2-ways'
  title='Refactor Framer Motion For Smaller Bundles'
  date='2021-10-10'
  description='How to refactor a component from using framer-motion to pure css'
  tags={['framer-motion', 'refactor', 'css', 'React', 'styled-components', 'Typescript']}
/>

## Example With Framer Motion

The code below is a stripped down and altered example of the Blog card that gets displayed in a grid list
on this website. The alterations are as follows. I have wrapped the component in `<LazyMotion
features={domAnimation}>` so that it adds as small a bundle size as possible. You would usually wrap a
higher order component with this. Wrapping in LazyMotion allows the code to use the smaller `m` instead
of `motion` import for the `AnchorContainer`. I have also used style props so that it works in a code
playground easily. Better options are tailwindcss or plain CSS modules.

                {tag}
              </Pill>
            ))}
          </div>
        </div>
      </AnchorContainer>
    </LazyMotion>
  );
}
```

Let's break this down a little. Framer motion allows us to stagger the animations of a child component
with [variants](https://www.framer.com/docs/examples/#variants). We use `staggerChildren: 0.07` on
the variant for our AnchorContainer component. This will cause the animation for the Pill component to be
staggered such that each pill waits to start it's animation.  The animations are very declarative, we
just tell Framer Motion what the key states of an animation should be, that we want all children
animations of AnchorContainer to be staggered, and it handles the starting, stopping, and reversing for
us. We tell Framer Motion when to start animating towards a state, either `notActivated` or
`activated`, and Framer Motion will handle all of the details about when to animate smoothly forward or
backward for us. Even if the mouse or focus on a BlogCard is suddenly changed Framer Motion will just pickup from where it is at and smoothly start transitioning to the next requested state.

The animation states are triggered by the `onMouseEnter()`, `onMouseLeave()`, `onFocus()`, and
`onBlur()` events of the main anchor element. You will notice that we used a separate `activated`,
`useState()` and an extra `useEffect()` hook to determine when the animations should start and then
reverse themselves. We had to define the activated state because if we tried to do the following...

```tsx
  const controls = useAnimation();
  const [hovered, setHovered] = useState(false);
  const [focused, setFocused] = useState(false);


  useEffect(() => {
    if (focused || hovered) {
      controls.start('activated');
    } else {
      controls.start('notActivated');
    }
  }, [hovered, focused, controls]);
```

...we would have ended up triggering the staggered animation over and over again every time the mouse
enters or leaves the card, even when it is already activated with a keyboard selection. It starts to
animate wave after wave that overlap and look glitchy. Try it out!

I have also used styled to define the look of the main anchor element and the pill elements. You will
notice that the styled anchor element wraps the motion anchor element `const AnchorContainer =
styled(m.a)`. This is an awesome [feature](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled#styling-any-component).

## The Missing Prop

Unfortunately this version of the component is less re-usable because we are using `m.a` ("aka"
`motion.a`) as our main wrapping component. With Typescript this is going to cause us to have a difficult
time using the **...rest** prop. We have to manually define any props, such as style that we want users
to be able to pass through. I usually like to pass `{...rest}` to the main wrapping HTML element of my
components because it means that I can use it somewhere else and attach extra props to it as needed. With
Typescript we need to also define a union for our CardProps that include the base elements type to do this. Usually that would look like...

```tsx
type CardProps = {...} &
React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>

export function CardProps() {
  return (
    <AnchorContainer {...rest}>
      ...
    </AnchorContainer>
  );
}
```

However that will not work on this version of AnchorContainer because it is an `m.a` component, not a
simple `<a\>` element. The typings for `m.a` are...

`ForwardRefComponent<HTMLAnchorElement, HTMLMotionProps<"a">>`

...Yuck! not to mention the issues you will then get from missing Framer Motion
specific props that are then required to be passed in. It is a mess.

## The Example Refactored with @emotion/styled

To make this work entirely with @emotion/styled we get to use a couple of cool features. We are
going to use the **custom props** feature to create staggered delays on our Pill animation. We are also
going to use the **component reference** -> `${Component}` feature to refer to Pill from within
AnchorContainer. I will note that for the codesandbox I had to use a next.js project to get .babelrc and
the [@emotion babel-plugin](https://emotion.sh/docs/babel) plugin working correctly so that I could use
the `${Component}` feature. Once again, I have also used the style prop for this quick demo instead of
pure css or tailwindcss (both of which are preferable).

          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </AnchorContainer>
  );
}
```

Only a few things have changed on the Pill component. We define a very standard CSS animation using
keyframes in which the Pill starts at 0px, translates Y to -10px, and back to 0px. CSS infers the 0% and
100% states so we only need to define the 50%. When we map over the tags prop to create each pill we
pass a **custom prop**, `delay: number`, to assign a staggered animation-delay to each pill. Lastly,
and very important we give it the `will-change: transform` CSS property so that the GPU handles
rendering to create a smooth animation.

Animating the main AnchorContainer on **hover** and **focus** is easy, we just use a standard
`transition: translateY(-10px)` on `:hover` and `:focus` pseudo-events. The exciting part is that
we can assign the hop animation to each Pill component on :hover and :focus of the AnchorContainer using
the `${Pill}` syntax. `${Pill}` is translated into the generated class name for Pill by @emotion/styled. Referencing one styled component from another can be found in the [official docs](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled#targeting-another-emotion-component). You will also need to install
this [@emotion babel-plugin](https://emotion.sh/docs/babel) for it to work with SSR (i.e. Next.js). the
babel plugin is well worth it for the dead code elimination and minification alone though so I highly
recommend it for everyone.

## What We Lost

The only issue with animating in this way as compared to using Framer Motion is that if we leave the
hover or focus state prior to the animation finishing the pills quickly snap back to their original
position rather than smoothly and gracefully reversing the current animation. CSS (as far as I know) has
no way to keep track of what frame it is currently on and then smoothly reverse course when the hover or
focus state changes.

## What We Gained

We have eliminated 23k g-zipped of javascript from this component alone. That may not seem like much, but
across a larger application that could really add up. We have also regained the ability to use this
component in other parts of our application or even other applications with correct Typescript typings
using React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement\>

<!-- >It is important that we also assign animation-fill-mode: forwards for some animations, this one in
particular it does not matter for but if we are animating such that the end style is different than the
beginning we will want to use this. The CSS property
[animation-fill-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-fill-mode) sets how a
CSS animation applies styles to its target before and after its execution. This just ensures that the
animation will play forward once and keep the styles of an element as defined at the 100% keyframe mark. -->
