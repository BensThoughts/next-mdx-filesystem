> Sometimes the right path is not the easiest.

Early on in the development cycle of this blog I was still deciding between
using a fully featured component library and rolling my own. I had used
[Angular Material Design](https://material.angular.io/) in the past on an
Angular project and been quite happy with the results.  It handed me
*beautiful*, **fully accessible** components on a platter. It worked well
for the project it was used in because I had to implement a ton of backend and
frontend infrastructure logic on my own. I did not have the time to also
roll my own library of front-end components for that project.

I knew that for my personal development blog I was going to want more
customization over the look and feel of every component and that Material Design
was to strict in the constraints provided to implement what I wanted to.
This lead me to do lots of research and testing on component libraries
that claimed to be less constrained. I finally landed on
[chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/). During the first week of writing the
infrastructure for this blog I thought that I had found the holy grail. A
component library which was not only using
[@emotion/styled](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) but fully encouraged the
use of it to the extent that they require you install @emotion/styled as a
primary dependency with your project. This was a sign to me that I could
completely re-style the components included in the library and not have to worry
about making sure they were bullet proof in the accessibility department.

## ...Fail Fast, Fail Often...

Fortunately I ran into my first issue using a @chakra-ui within a week of
using it. The dreaded blue-outline...

![Blue Ring
Issue](v1631126762/blog/blog/why-not-to-use-a-component-library/blue-ring_xvkgla.png)

As you can see in the image above, there is a bright blue outline on this simple
icon button. It is a css-shadow property that shows up when the button is
clicked or navigated to with the keyboard. I searched for 3-4 hours for a
solution to the issue. It seemed like no matter what I did I could not get
the color of the outline to change. My research unveiled that the outline
is part of their **accessibility** design.

The very 2 problems I was trying to solve (full customization & accessibility)
were now in conflict with each other because the component library I had chosen
made a decision about the effects of style on accessibility. There were a
couple of solutions floating around the web [Github issue
708](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/issues/708) but they involved
installing yet another dependency as well as disabling the outline entirely.
What if I want an outline, but just a different color? Do I really
want to track and manage yet another dependency just for the outline on some
components?

It became clear to me that the simplest solution would be to implement my own
component library from scratch in which I have full control over every pixel on
screen. While this may seem daunting at first, and may take a little more
time in the beginning of a project it will save countless hours of frustration
in the future. There are certain problems for which accessibility is hard to
implement, such as modals, tooltips, dropdowns, and tabs. The good news is
that there are great libraries out there which solve these issues with **ZERO**
design. They are called ***Headless UI*** component libraries. Two
great ones are [Reach UI](https://reach.tech/) and
[Headless-UI](https://headlessui.dev/)
